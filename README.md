##🏥 Smart Healthcare Analytics System
Integrated AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support Platform

Overview:

The Smart Healthcare Analytics System is a comprehensive, data-driven platform designed to enhance medical decision-making through the integration of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Time-Series Forecasting.

The system analyzes multi-modal healthcare data—including patient symptoms, medical imaging, and vital signs—to deliver accurate disease predictions, risk assessments, and preliminary treatment insights. It is built as a scalable and modular solution to support proactive and personalized healthcare delivery.

System Architecture:

The platform consists of four integrated analytical modules:

🔹 NLP Module — Disease Prediction

Processes textual symptom inputs using machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to predict potential diseases.

🔹 Image Analysis Module — Medical Imaging

Utilizes deep learning (CNN) to analyze medical images such as X-rays for detecting abnormalities and supporting diagnosis.

🔹 Time-Series Module — Vital Forecasting

Applies forecasting techniques to monitor patient vitals (e.g., heart rate, temperature) and predict potential health risks over time.

🔹 Integrated Dashboard

A unified Streamlit-based interface that consolidates all modules, enabling real-time insights, visualization, and user interaction.
